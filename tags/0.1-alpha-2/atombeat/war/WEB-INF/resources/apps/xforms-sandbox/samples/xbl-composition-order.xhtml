        <p>This test shows that, the current version (3rd April 2009) processes XBL bound elements following the document order. You can tell that
            because the first time the component is called (with number=1) it sees 2 bound elements (its own one and the embeded one which is not yet
            replaced by its shadow tree) This can be issue in some cases (see <a
                href="http://sites.google.com/a/orbeon.com/forms/projects/xforms-component-system/xbl-components-processing-order"

        <foo:component id="c1" number="1">
            <p>Test number 1</p>
            <foo:component id="c2" number="2">
                <p>Test number 2</p>
            </foo:component>
