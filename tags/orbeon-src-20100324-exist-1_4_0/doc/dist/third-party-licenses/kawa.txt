License for the Kawa software

The license for Kawa and the packages it depends on is a "modified Gnu Public
License". You can find it in the file COPYING in the Kawa sources, and also
quoted here:.

     The Java classes (with related files and documentation) in these packages
     are copyright (C) 1996, 1997, 1998, 1999 Per Bothner.

     These classes are distributed in the hope that they will be useful, but
     WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
     MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. See the GNU
     General Public License for more details.

     These classes are free software. You can use and re-distribute a class
     without restriction (in source or binary form) as long as you use a version
     that has not been modified in any way from a version released by Per
     Bothner, Red Hat inc, or the Free Software Foundation. You may make and
     distribute a modified version, provided you follow the terms of the GNU
     General Public License; either version 2, or (at your option) any later
     version.


The file COPYING also contains a copy of the GNU General Public License
version 2.

People have asked what the Kawa license means in practice. Informally, you get
to pick between these choices:

   1. Use Kawa as distributed by Per Bothner, Red Hat Inc, or the Free Software
      Foundation (or their approved agents), with no modifications. In that
      case, you can use Kawa for any purpose you like, and distribute your
      application with any license you like. (This basically gives you the same
      rights as a typical commercial royalty-free re-distribution license.)

   2. Obey the terms of the standard Gnu Public License. (See
      http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/gpl.html). Informally, this means that if you
      distribute any application that is based on Kawa, you must also make
      available to all your recipients (customers) the source code for your
      entire application, giving them the modification and re-distribution
      rights they have under the GPL. In a Java context, I take "entire
      application" to mean all classes (and native code) that run in the same
      Java virtual machine, except for the Java runtime system itself (the
      virtual machine, low-level run-time system, and any classes in a java or
      javax package).

   3. If you need to make a change to Kawa, you can submit them to Per Bothner,
      and convince him to include them in future Kawa releases.

   4. You can negotiate some other (commercial) license with Per Bothner.

In general, if the license of Kawa or associated packages causes difficulties,
let me know.

Kawa uses some math routines from fdlib's libf77, which bear the following
