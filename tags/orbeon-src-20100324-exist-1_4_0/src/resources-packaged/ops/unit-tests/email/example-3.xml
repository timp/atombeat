PresentationServer benefits from standardized forms processing using XForms, rich controller semantics, and full-featured XML pipelines. PresentationServer is in fact built around Orbeon's optimized XML pipeline engine, a mature, high-performance engine for pipeline processing of XML. PresentationServer is ideal for building Composite Applications in a Service Oriented Architecture (SOA), an can be used on its own, or within the OIS suite.</p>
