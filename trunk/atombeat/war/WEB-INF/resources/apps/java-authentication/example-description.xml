        This example shows how:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>You can restrict the access to a page with the standard authentication mechanisms provided by your application server.</li>
        <li>You can programmatically obtain the name of the currently logged in user, as well as other security related information.</li>
        <li>You can implement a "logout" functionality.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        If you have <a href="/doc/intro-install">configured authentication in your application server</a>, access to
        this application requires you to login through a login page. After you have successfully logged in, the
        application displays your username and other authentication information.
    </p>
    <p>
        If you followed the <a href="/doc/intro-install">installation instructions to the letter</a>, the username and
        password are <code>orbeonadmin/xforms</code>.
    </p>
