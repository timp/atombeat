<h2>Hello World!</h2>
<p>This is a maven web application with a war overlay dependency.</p>
<p>This file should override the index.jsp provided in the overlaid webapp.</p>
<p>If the example-maven-webapp project has been successfully overlaid on this project, you should be able to view a web page at <a href="example.jsp">example.jsp</a>.</p>
<p>If you have eclipse configured for instant gratification successfully, you should be able to edit this file and see changes appear in your browser without having to rebuild the project using maven.</p>
<p>Note that if you make changes to the dependency project (example-maven-webapp) you <strong>will</strong> need to rebuild and install the project via maven to see the changes appear in this application.</p>
