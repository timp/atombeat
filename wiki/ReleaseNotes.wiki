== issue 118 - 	implement md5 in @hash link extension attribute for media-link entries ==

If the FILE media storage mode is being used, an MD5 hash will automatically be calculated for every new and updated media resource, and the hash value will be added to the associated media-link entry in a @hash attribute on both the 'edit-media' link and the atom:content element.

This is a backwards compatible change, in that upgrading to this release does not require any migration of the data. However, note that media-link entries created prior to upgrade will not include a @hash attribute. 

== issue 114 - configure self link uri base independently from edit uri base ==

The way in which the URI base for 'self', 'edit' and 'edit-media' links is configured has changed. The variable $config:content-service-url in the config/shared.xqm configuration module has been removed. Three new variables have been added in it's place, being $config:self-link-uri-base, $config:edit-link-uri-base and $config:edit-media-link-uri-base. These new variables allow URI bases for different link types to be configured independently if desired.

Upgrading to this release will require modification of the config/shared.xqm to use the new configuration variables.

== issue 24 - provide service documents ==

This release implements Atom Protocol service documents. E.g., if an !AtomBeat service is located at at http://example.org/atombeat/service/ then a GET request to this URI will return an Atom Protocol service document listing available Atom collections.

The title and summary given in the atom:workspace element in the service document are configured using two new variables in the config/shared.xqm configuration module, being $config:workspace-title and $config:workspace-summary.

Upgrading to this release will require modification of the config/shared.xqm to use the new configuration variables.

Note also that collections created prior to upgrading to this release will not initially appear in the service document. They will appear after an update to the collection feed metadata, i.e., after a PUT to the collection URI. 

== issue 97 - remove ".atom" from the end of member URIs ==

In this release the string ".atom" is no longer appending to member URIs. 

This is a major change, and requires that all member URIs present in the database prior to upgrade, e.g., in Atom entry documents, need to be modified following an upgrade to have the ".atom" suffix removed.

Note however that the documents stored in the eXist database still retain the ".atom" suffix, i.e., the documents themselves don't need to be moved.
