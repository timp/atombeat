#summary A tutorial on getting started with AtomBeat.

= Introduction =

This tutorial covers the following topics:

  * downloading and installing AtomBeat
  * creating an Atom collection and retrieving an Atom feed
  * creating, retrieving, updating and deleting Atom collection members
  * creating, retrieving, updating and deleting media resources  

= Prerequisites =

You will need to have a servlet container like [http://tomcat.apache.org/download-60.cgi Tomcat] or [http://docs.codehaus.org/display/JETTY/Downloading+Jetty Jetty] installed on your computer, and you will need to know how to deploy a WAR file. AtomBeat 0.1 has been tested with Tomcat 6.0 and Jetty 6.1.

You will need to have the cURL HTTP command-line utility installed on your computer. If you're on a Linux computer, you probably already have curl installed, or can install it via a software repository, e.g.:

{{{
$ sudo apt-get install curl
}}}

If you are on a Windows or Mac computer, you can [http://curl.haxx.se/download.html download cURL] and install it manually.

OPTIONAL: You might also like to install a TCP proxy so you can observe the communication between the client (cURL) and server (AtomBeat). There are a couple of options here. You can download and install [https://tcpmon.dev.java.net/ tcpmon] on any operating system. You can also install a very simple utility called [http://hathawaymix.org/Software/TCPWatch tcpwatch], e.g.:

{{{
$ sudo apt-get install tcpwatch-httpproxy
$ tcpwatch-httpproxy -L 8081:8080 &
}}}

This tutorial assumes you have your servlet container installed and listening on port 8080.

This tutorial also assumes you have a TCP proxy installed and running, listening on port 8081 and forwarding to port 8080. If you are doing this tutorial without a TCP proxy, replace "8081" with "8080" wherever you see it below.

= Downloading and Installing AtomBeat =

We are going to be downloading and installing one of the WAR packages available for AtomBeat. Specifically, we are going to be using the *atombeat-exist-full* WAR package. This package is exactly as the eXist 1.4 web application, but with the AtomBeat web services overlaid. For more information on the different packages available, see TODO.

Go to the [http://code.google.com/p/atombeat/downloads/list AtomBeat downloads page] in your browser, click on the latest version of atombeat-exist-full and download it to your computer. Or, from the command line, e.g.:

{{{
$ wget http://atombeat.googlecode.com/files/atombeat-exist-full-0.1-RC7.war
}}}
